### Abstract
Testing to see if the yield function is correct when density dependence operates
on natural mortality or fecundity. Using a simulation framework and the
BALEEN II population dynamics model as an operating model, plots of yield versus
mature population were plotted across a range of MSYL and MSYR values.

### Methods
The BALEEN II (@punt_1999) population dynamics model, parameterized for the
Norewegian harvest of minke whales, was used as an operating model (OM).
The OM time series include 100 years of data and was ran for 400 iterations,
with each iteration containing zero process error, but having observation error
in the estimates of abundance.

In all simulations, density dependence acted on the mature population either
through fecundity (*f*) or natural mortality (*m*). All combinations of true
MSYL and MSYR values were simulated for both density dependence scenarios.

### Results
The current parameterization of the BALEEN II population dynamics model produces
biased results.
