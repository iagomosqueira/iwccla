\section{ABSTRACT}\label{abstract}

\subsection{Two variants of the Catch Limit Algorithm, \emph{CLA} (the
original \emph{CLA} adopted by the Commission, and an alternative
version produced by Norway) are evaluated using the trials identified by
the Scientific Committee as well as additional trials that consider
density-dependence on natural mortality rather than on fecundity and
additional ways in which the environmental change could impact whale
dynamics. Results are shown for projection periods of 100 and 300 years.
and are summarized by tables of performance statistics and
`response curves'.}

\subsubsection{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

The Revised Management Procedure (RMP) of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) \autocite{iwc_2013_rmp} represents a rigorously-tested
mechanism to provide risk-averse advice regarding catch limits for
baleen whales. The catch limit algorithm (\emph{CLA}), the process used
to calculate area-specific catch limits, represents a major component of
the RMP. The \emph{CLA} was developed based on a set of
simulation trials which explored the performance of candidate
\emph{CLAs} given uncertainty in population dynamics and demographic
parameters. Before any changes can be made to the established RMP,
results from an agreed upon list of \emph{CLA} trials must be used to
highlight differences in performance between the established procedure
and the suggested replacement \autocite{iwc_2007}.

Norway stated at the 2004 meeting that it intended to develop and
propose a change to the \emph{CLA} of the RMP. Norway also proposed that
the Maximum Sustained Yield Rate (MSYR) should refer to the $1^+$
component of the population (with $MSYR_{1+} = 1\%$ as the minimum)
instead of the mature component. The revised tuning mechanism and some
simulation results were presented at the 2006 meeting, and these were
discussed extensively. The Scientific Committee established two working
groups at the 2006 meeting, which led to the MSYR review,
completed in 2013 \autocite{iwc_2013}, and the \emph{CLA} group,
which specified trials and diagnostic plots for testing amendments
to the \emph{CLA} \autocite{iwc_2007}.
Revised results \autocite{aldrin_2007} were presented to the Committee in 2007.
However, the MSYR review had not been completed so no decision was made
at that time. The MSYR review was completed in 2013 and it concluded
that the lower bound for MSYR in trials should be $MSYR_{1+} = 1\%$.

\subsubsection{METHODS}\label{methods}

\emph{Trials structure}

The Scientific Committee agreed on a set of trials that should be
conducted when a proposal were to be made for a revision to the
\emph{CLA}, to highlight the differences in performance of the
procedures (\autocite{iwc_2007}; Table 1). The IWC \autocite{iwc_2007} also proposed
that `response curve' plots be produced for MSY rates of 1\%, 1.5\%, and
4\% and the following scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  initial depletion of 0.05\emph{K}, 0.1\emph{K}, 0.2\emph{K},
  0.3\emph{K} (R trials), 0.4\emph{K}, 0.5\emph{K}, 0.6\emph{K} (S
  trials), 0.8\emph{K}, and 0.99\emph{K} (D trials);
\item
  unreported catch level (for initial depletion levels of 0.3\emph{K},
  0.6\emph{K}, and 0.99\emph{K}), where the reported catch is either
  100\%, 80\%, 60\%, 40\%, 20\%, or 1\% of the true catch; and
\item
  positive bias in survey estimates (for initial depletion levels of
  0.3\emph{K}, 0.6\emph{K}, and 0.99\emph{K}): No bias (1.0), 1.2, 1.4,
  1.6, 1.8, and 2.0.
\end{enumerate}

The tables of results and the response curve plots show how total catch,
final population size, lowest populations size,
and average annual catch variation (AAV) change as aspects of the trials are changed.
Results are not shown for the relative recovery statistic, realized protection level,
and the continuing catch statistics owing to difficulties in defining these
statistics when natural mortality is changing over time
(and because these statistics were not used to select previous RMP variants).
Population sizes are scaled by \emph{K}, except when \emph{K} varies.
In these cases, the final population size (\emph{Pf}) and lowest
minimum population size over the distribution (\emph{Pmin}) are scaled by
the population size resulting if no catch is taken in the management period.
The reported statistics are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Total catch (TC) distribution: (a) median, (b) 5th \%ile, (c) 96th
  \%ile, and (d) mean;
\item
  \emph{Pf} distribution: (a) median, (b) 5th \%ile, and (c) 96th \%ile;
\item
  \emph{Pmin} distribution: (a) median, (b) 5th \%ile, and (c) 96th
  \%ile; and
\item
  AAV distribution.
\end{enumerate}

All trials are conducted for 100-year and 300-year projection periods
when density-dependence acts on fecundity or natural mortality
\autocite{johnson_2015_iwc1} and whether MSYR pertains to the total (1+)
or mature female component of the population. For consistency, MSYL and
the density-dependence component are assumed to pertain to the same population
component as that to which MSYR pertains.

~

\emph{Implementation}

All simulations used MANTST, a FORTRAN program, which is available from
the IWC secretariat. MANTST version 15, used here, has several options,
where options for a single base trial are shown in Appendix (Table 3).

Table 4 lists the specifications for the two \emph{CLA} variants
considered.

\subsubsection{RESULTS}\label{results}

Table 5 lists the values for the performance statistics for the two
\emph{CLA} variants for the six base-case trials (T1-D1, T1-D4, T1-S1,
T1-S4, T1-R1, T1-R4) for the two simulation lengths, for whether MSYR
pertains to the total (1+) or mature female components of the population
and the two choices for density-dependence. The results for
$MSYR_{1+}=1\%$ and $MSYR_{mat}=4\%$ are the focus for additional
analyses as these choices were selected during the MSYR review.
